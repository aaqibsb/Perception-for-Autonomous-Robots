## DESCRIPTION:
proj4_artroom.py - Stereo Vision pipeline for artroom dataset\
proj4_chess.py - Stereo Vision pipeline for chess dataset\
proj4_ladder.py - Stereo Vision pipeline for ladder dataset

## ENVIRONMENT USED:
JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition

## LIBRARIES USED:
Install the following libraries through the Pycharm IDE. Type the library name and if the IDE doesn't detect it, there will be a yellow line below the library name. Hover over the yellow line and option will pop up to install the library/package.

## GETTING STARTED:
Install the necessary libraries to have the code set up for running.

## RUNNING THE CODE:
Click the play button on the top right corner or use the shortcut (Shift+F10).

### INSTRUCTIONS:
For all the scripts, run the script respective to the dataset. First, the epipolar lines will be displayed. After closing that window, the rectified images will be displayed. After pressing any button, the rectified images windows will close and the SSD algorithm will run to calculate depth and disparity. Wait for a few minutes as this process is computation heavy. In a few minutes, the disparity color map and grayscale map will be displayed. After pressing any button, the depth color map and grayscale map will be displayed.
