## INSTRUCTIONS:
Project2_Q1.py - Once the script runs, the video will pop up in a window. The video frame will show all the detected corner points in cyan color and after the video finishes playing, a plot will be generated that displays the roll, pitch, yaw and translations in x, y, z directions. 

Project2_Q2.py - Once the script runs, three images will pop up showing stitched images between 1-2, 2-3 and 3-4. If the matched features are to be displayed, uncomment lines 36-37 and comment imshow() functions for the unrequired stitches.
